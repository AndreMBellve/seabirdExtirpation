# seabirdExtirpation
Code for a agent-based model of seabird colony extirpation.


##Ideas for development

- Allow for pest incursion:
    This could be a datafile that specifies a year that the pests arrive, as well as a ramp building up predation levels, and/or a potential start time of control initiatives with a ramp for effectiveness. Fluctuations in pest numbers???

- Some way to include climate change?

- Modifiers of island attractiveness (e.g. distance to food source or another colony???? May not be much data for this)

- Correct emigration to prevent islands swapping individuals
